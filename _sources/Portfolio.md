## Who is Michael Lam? 
Hi,you might be browsing this website because you want to find out more about who Michael Lam is, or you could also just have found this from searching on Google! Regardless, welcome! 

## My background:
I am a recent Physics graduate from UC Santa Barbara. If I were to come up with a name for the focus of courses that I have taken, I would say Condensed Matter and Optics Applications. In my opinion, my two quarters of Condensed Matter, one quarter of Optics and one quarter of quantum photonic experiment shaped my perspective as a physics student driven by physical applications. 

## Research:
I have one year of research experience in photonics in the materials department under supervision of Dr. Shuji Nakamura. I have also previously conducted research at San Francisco State University for a mitigation lab to help develop a program for Dr. Zhaoshuo Jiang.
